This is a repository for chip image segmentation.
## Details   
The file Clip_IC_image_256.py in the dataset directory is primarily responsible for cropping 1024×1024 IC images into 256×256 patches. This preprocessing step facilitates subsequent data augmentation operations. The script dataset_split.py is used to divide the images and their corresponding labels in the dataset into training, testing, and validation subsets. The purpose of remove_black.py is to eliminate IC images that share identical label masks, thereby removing redundant samples from the dataset. Lastly, remove_no_label_img.py is designed to discard IC images that do not have corresponding annotation labels, ensuring consistency between image and label pairs in the dataset.
